## my aerospace config

My config files for window manager from here: https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace

The most promising macos tiling WM so far. It seems actively developed, not too
buggy and supports directional navigation.


## TODOs
- layouts kind of suck. There isn't anything good for ultrawide layouts
- managing spaces across monitors is a pain
- by-direction window focus can't move across screens
- [janky borders](https://github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBorders?tab=readme-ov-file) doesn't seem to be working
